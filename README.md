<h2>📜 Design Overview</h2>
<p>
  The 1x3 router is designed to route data packets from a single input to one of three output lines. 
  The system uses a modular design approach with the following submodules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>FIFO:</b> Manages data storage and retrieval efficiently.</li>
  <li><b>Synchronizer:</b> Ensures data integrity across clock domains.</li>
  <li><b>Register:</b> Temporarily holds data for processing.</li>
  <li><b>FSM:</b> Controls the routing logic based on input conditions.</li>
</ul>
